# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and maintainers of this repository, pledge to create a welcoming, friendly, and inclusive environment for everyone. We are committed to providing a harassment-free experience for all, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our goal is to help learners explore Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with Java while fostering a supportive community. By participating in this project, you agree to uphold these standards, contributing to a positive, constructive, and encouraging space for all.

## Our Standards

To cultivate an open and inviting atmosphere, we ask that members, contributors, and maintainers adhere to the following guidelines:

### Positive Behaviors

- **Be respectful and inclusive**: Respect differing perspectives, and welcome newcomers.
- **Use welcoming language**: Create a friendly and approachable tone in your interactions.
- **Provide constructive feedback**: Offer suggestions that are helpful and encouraging, rather than critical or dismissive.
- **Acknowledge and celebrate accomplishments**: Recognize and praise the contributions and learning of others.
- **Accept responsibility and apologize when necessary**: Recognize that mistakes happen, and encourage learning from them.
  
### Unacceptable Behaviors

Examples of behavior that will not be tolerated include but are not limited to:

- **Harassment and Discrimination**: Offensive comments, derogatory language, or personal attacks based on personal attributes or identity.
- **Demeaning or exclusionary language**: Any language or comments that alienate, shame, or belittle others.
- **Disrespectful or dismissive behavior**: Ignoring others' contributions or shutting down ideas without reasoned feedback.
- **Inappropriate content**: Sharing or linking to sexually explicit, violent, or otherwise inappropriate material.
- **Intimidation, bullying, or unwelcome attention**: Including, but not limited to, sustained interruptions or uninvited personal messages.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers and community moderators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards. They have the right to take action to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

Maintainers and moderators may also ban any contributor, temporarily or permanently, if they engage in behavior that is deemed inappropriate, threatening, or harmful to the community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including issues, pull requests, comments, discussions, and other community forums related to this repository. It also applies to interactions with our community in other venues, such as social media channels or conferences, where relevant.

## Reporting Issues

If you observe or experience behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by emailing the repository maintainer(s) directly at [Your Email Address Here]. We are committed to promptly reviewing and addressing all reports and will take appropriate actions to maintain a positive and constructive environment.

Reports of violations will be handled with sensitivity, confidentiality, and care. The information will only be shared with the necessary individuals involved in addressing the issue, and we will take all complaints seriously.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions, as determined by other members of the community or a higher authority.

For less severe violations, a warning may be given, followed by temporary or permanent banning for repeated offenses. In severe cases, such as harassment or discrimination, an immediate ban may be implemented.

## Acknowledgments

This Code of Conduct is based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).

## Additional Considerations

We encourage all contributors to also consider the following best practices:

- **Help Each Other**: Take a moment to guide or answer questions whenever possible.
- **Document Thoughtfully**: Make comments, readmes, and notes clear and accessible.
- **Encourage Learning**: Support each otherâ€™s growth and celebrate progress, however small.
